    <h2>My Education Background</h2>
    <p>
        In 10th grade, I enrolled at ORT Telnof Airforce school with a passion for technology and a keen interest <br />
        in electricity. There, I chose to specialize in industrial electricity and aircraft electricity, eager to gain <br />
        practical knowledge and hands-on experience in these fields. Throughout my time at ORT Telnof, I immersed myself<br />
        in the study of electrical systems, learning about their components, functions, and maintenance.<br /><br />
        I delved into topics such as circuitry, power distribution, and electrical safety protocols. The school provided an environment <br />
        that fostered both theoretical learning and practical application, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the <br />
        subject matter. To further enhance my knowledge and gain real-world exposure, I sought opportunities beyond the <br />
        classroom. I decided to work as an IDF Civilian Worker, seizing the chance to apply my skills in a professional <br />
        setting. This experience allowed me to collaborate with skilled technicians, engineers, and military personnel, <br />
        contributing to various projects and gaining valuable insights into the intricacies of electrical systems within <br />
        the defense industry. <br /><br />  
        During my time as an IDF Civilian Worker, I had the opportunity to work on a range of assignments, from <br />
        troubleshooting electrical issues in aircraft to performing maintenance on critical infrastructure.<br />
        I honed my problem-solving abilities, adapting to new challenges and finding innovative solutions. The fast-paced and <br />
        demanding nature of the work instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility and discipline. <br />
        Additionally, I participated in specialized training programs that further expanded my expertise. I received comprehensive <br />
        instruction in advanced electrical systems specific to aircraft, acquiring a deep understanding of avionics, navigation systems, <br />
        and communication equipment. <br /><br />
        This training exposed me to cutting-edge technologies and instilled in me the importance of precision and <br />
        attention to detail when working in high-stakes environments. Through my journey at ORT Telnof Airforce school and <br />
        my role as an IDF Civilian Worker, I not only developed a strong foundation in industrial and aircraft electricity <br />
        but also fostered essential skills such as teamwork, adaptability, and effective communication. These experiences <br />
        solidified my passion for technology and ignited a drive to pursue a career that combines my technical expertise with <br />
        my desire to make a positive impact. Now, armed with a wealth of knowledge and practical experience, I am ready to <br />
        embark on new challenges, leveraging my skills as I continue to grow professionally in the field of Technical Writing, <br />
        and obtaining new knowledge from courses I have completed such as the Software Manual Testing Course and the Fullstack <br />
        Web Development Bootcamp Course by Angela Yu.
